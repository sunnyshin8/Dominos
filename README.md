Disabled students provide input to our chatbot through speech or other methods, and in response, a Ben 10-style creature appears and delivers replies in its own voice. This feature makes the interaction much more engaging and ensures that the students feel included. The animated creature not only captures their attention but also enhances the overall experience, making it fun and interactive. This approach helps to ensure that all students, regardless of their abilities, can participate fully and feel valued in theÂ conversation.
